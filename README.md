## Project Overview

- **Objective:** Forecast the number of products sold for the next 30 days using a simple linear regression model.
- **Data:** The dataset includes historical sales data with dates and corresponding product sales numbers.
- **Visualization:** The final output includes a line plot with markers showing both the historical sales data and the 30-day forecast. A screenshot of this final visualization is included.

## Files Included

- **Jupyter Notebook:** The notebook contains all the code for data preprocessing, model building, forecasting, and visualization.
- **Dataset:** The CSV file containing the historical sales data.
- **Final Visualization Screenshot:** An image of the final forecast plot.
